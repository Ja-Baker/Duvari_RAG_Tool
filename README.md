# 🧠 Duvari AI Candidate Search - Production RAG System

## 🚀 Full OpenAI RAG Functionality

This is the **production-ready** AI candidate search system with complete RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) capabilities that will **blow your clients' socks off**.

### ⚡ What Makes This Special

**🧠 True AI Intelligence:**
- OpenAI GPT-3.5 parses natural language queries
- 1536-dimensional vector embeddings for semantic search
- Cosine similarity matching for precise relevance
- AI-generated response formatting

**🔍 Three Search Modes:**
1. **Hybrid Search**: Best of semantic + keyword (recommended)
2. **Semantic Search**: Pure AI understanding and matching
3. **Keyword Search**: Traditional filtering for comparison

**🎯 Real-Time Performance:**
- Vector index built on startup
- Embedding caching for speed
- Sub-3-second response times
- Real-time relevance scoring

## 🚀 Railway Deployment

### Quick Deploy to Railway:

     - `DATA_FILE_PATH` = `duvari_NFA_data.json`

3. **System Will Auto-Boot:**
   - Loads 1000+ candidates
   - Builds vector index with OpenAI embeddings
   - Ready for blazing-fast searches

## 🎯 API Endpoints

### Main Search (Full RAG)
```bash
POST /search
{
  "query": "Senior machine learning engineer with Python and TensorFlow experience",
  "type": "hybrid"  # or "semantic" or "keyword"
}
```

### Advanced RAG Search
```bash
POST /rag-search  
{
  "query": "DevOps engineer with Kubernetes expertise",
  "k": 10,
  "threshold": 0.7
}
```

### System Health
```bash
GET /health
# Returns vector index status, candidates loaded, OpenAI config
```

## 🎯 Client Demo Script

**"Watch this - I'll show you the future of candidate searching."**

1. **Natural Language Demo:**
   - Type: "Senior Python developer with machine learning experience"
   - Show AI parsing the query in real-time
   - Display semantic matches with relevance scores

2. **Comparison Demo:**
   - Search "AI engineer" with keyword search → Limited results
   - Same query with semantic search → Finds ML, data science, NLP candidates
   - Show the AI "gets it" contextually

3. **Speed Demo:**
   - Multiple rapid searches showing sub-3-second responses
   - Real-time vector processing
   - No database lag

**Result: "This is how we find candidates others miss, in seconds not hours."**
